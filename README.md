# Portfolio

I tried to create a simple yet useful responsive website to demonstrate how far I've learnt so far. Of course, this is not the final version. It'll be highly likely be updated soon!

Frontend technologies, libraries and/or frameworks that are being used for my portfolio are:

``` 
HTML5
CSS6
Bootstrap
```

``` javascript 
console.log("Hello world!")
```
